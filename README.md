# Virtual Bookstore System

This is an academic Java project that simulates a virtual bookstore system using core data structures such as stacks, queues, and graphs. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithm implementation (including Dijkstra's algorithm), and basic system design without using external frameworks.

## Features

- Book management system with categories
- Book recommendation based on graph similarity (Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Stack-based system for recently viewed books
- Queue-based system for next-to-read list
- Random book recommendations
- Basic exception handling

## Technologies

- Java 21
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Custom data structures (Graph, Queue, Stack)
- CLI-based interface

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rafatav/virtual-library.git

2. Navigate to the project directory and open in your IDE.

3. Run the App class from the main package.

## Educational Purpose

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment and received the maximum score from the instructor. It is intended to showcase fundamental concepts in Java without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

While functional and educational, the system still has some architectural limitations, particularly related to class coupling and separation of concerns.
